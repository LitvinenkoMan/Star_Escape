Thank you for purchasing this awesome skin!

Notes:

There are two custom style added to the default unity gui parameters. 
HeaderText and PlainText. 

In Code:

GUILayout.Label ("TEXT HERE", "HeaderText");
GUILayout.Label ("TEXT HERE", "PlainText");

The names already explain the purpose of these text properties use them wisely.

For questions or suggestions please email me.
